Link has multiple requirements
1-href refers to where the css file is located in the file directory
2-rel refers to the relationship with the html file usually stylesheet
3-type means text/css

How to create tables in HTML:

Tables can be divided into three elements
1-Table head
2-Table Body
3-Table Footer

Table head
        <table> </table>
Syntax: <thead> </thead>
        <tr> Table Row </tr>
        <th> Table head </th> - Contains the headings of the columns

Table Body:
        <tbody> </tbody>
        <tr> Table Row </tr>
        <td> Table data </td> - Contains the data in the table. Use colspan to span two columns
                                Use rowspan to span two rows

Table Footer
        <tfoot> </tfoot>

Within HTML, we can add multiple classes to an HTML's element class attribute by seperating
with a space
        <div class="bold green"> </div>
        Here in this div, we are adding two classes bold and green and we can style them differently

Text-transform can be used to transform text into uppercase or lowercase

If an HTML element needs to styled uniquely no matter what class is applied to it 
We use id for declaring it
        <h1 id="" class="bold"> </h1>
For manipulating it, we use # in CSS

<h1 id="article-title" class="title uppercase">

In this example, we are uniquely styling via id and adding the CSS elements attributed to title and uppercase
While classes are meant to be used many times, an ID is meant to style only one element.

classes can be .bold 
classes can be .uppercase
classes can be .blue

With an html we can use <h1 class="bold blue uppercase> </h1>


Specificity:
This is a way in CSS to holder precedence over other element attributes
        ID's are most Specific
        Classes come next
        Followed last by tags
<h1 id="green" class="red"></h1>

the css :
    #green {
        color: green
    }
    .red {
        color: red
    }
    h1{
        color:blue
    }
In this case, the H1 will be green since its most Specific

When writing CSS rules, it’s possible to require an HTML element to have two 
or more CSS selectors at the same time.

    This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. 
    For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:

h1.special {

}

Chaining and Specificity:

So in HTML we can define a paragraph or any element with a class and then use
CSS to add styling to it

However, we can also chain elements together and apply a more specific CSS style to them.

For example

p {
        color: blue
}

makes the color blue for all paragraphs within the entire document

However,

.class_name p {
        color: red;
}

By chaining in the above situation, the paragraph nested inside the class_name will be turned
into red

This is called chaining and Specificity

If you use !important, it will override any specific attributes. It will override any style 
no matter how specific it is.

To apply CSS to multiple classes, use

h1, p {
        color: green;
}

                        CSS by tag p h1 h5 etc.
                        CSS by id #
                        CSS by class .
                        CSS select all *

        Font-family: Arial, Cursive, Times-New-Roman
        font-size: 18px
        font-weight: bold/normal - Controls how bold or thin text appears

        text-align: left/center/right - By default it appears to the left of the browser
        We can change it via using the 3 different values
        It aligns text to the element that holds it, i.e its parent

        Color-Two different types
        Foreground color - color of text
        Background color - color of Background

        Opacity. 1 represents 100% opaque. 0 represents None
        The background-image property will set the element’s background to display an image.

        Syntax: background-image: url('https://www.example.com/image.jpeg')


# Font-weight

Font weight allows us to decide whether we want an element's property to be bold or not

        # Font weight can also be a numeric value ranging from 100 - 900
        # 400 is the default
        # 700 denotes a bold font weight
        # 300 denotes a light font weight

# Font style

        #You can use font style to set the text to become italicized


        When selecting two classes to modify in CSS
        We use .className then .className {

        }

You can use em values: this allows the spacing to remain relative to the font-size

word-spacing can be used to style how much space you want between text of a paragraph i.e
        word-spacing: 5 em means 5 * the spacing of the font
        Usually em refers to the font size which by default is 16px

Letter spacing refers to how much space you want between letters
Again you can use em to decide how much space you want between the letters

        # We use text transform to change the text from uppercase and lowercase
        # text-transform: uppercase
        # text-transform: lowercase

The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:

        left - aligns text to the left hand side of the browser.
        center - centers text.
        right - aligns text to the right hand side of the browser.

Text decoration:

h1 {
  text-decoration: overline;
  display: block
}


h2 {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

h4 {
  text-decoration: underline overline;
}

        # display : block sets up whether we want to set up a vertical block or a horizontal block to represent the information
        # display: inline-block sets up a horizontal block

Line-height:

Think of line height as the number of enters you press to get to a difference in height between two lines of text

Example 

Example


Example

Line-height: 1.5
A unitless number, such as 1.2. 
This number is an absolute value that will compute the line height as a 
ratio of the font size. A unitless number is preferred since if the height of 
the element changes, it is easy to change the height dynamically

Fall-back fonts:

        Most computers come with a small font set including Arial, Times New Roman
        

h1 {
  font-family: "Garamond", "Times", serif;
}

This ^ above is called a fall-back font
It means use Garamond. If it is not available then use Times if that is not available
Then use serif from the PC


        use <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Space+Mono&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
        within head of the html document to add google fonts to your project


Font-Face 1:
        font-weight: bold 100 - 900
        font-style: italicized, underline etc
        line-height: vertical spacing between lines of text
        google fonts can be used with the link tag
        @font-face can also be used
        word-spacing: how far apart words are
        letter-spacing: how far apart letters are
