How to create tables in HTML:

Tables can be divided into three elements
1-Table head
2-Table Body
3-Table Footer

Table head
        <table> </table>
Syntax: <thead> </thead>
        <tr> Table Row </tr>
        <th> Table head </th> - Contains the headings of the columns

Table Body:
        <tbody> </tbody>
        <tr> Table Row </tr>
        <td> Table data </td> - Contains the data in the table. Use colspan to span two columns
                                Use rowspan to span two rows

Table Footer
        <tfoot> </tfoot>

Within HTML, we can add multiple classes to an HTML's element class attribute by seperating
with a space
        <div class="bold green"> </div>
        Here in this div, we are adding two classes bold and green and we can style them differently

Text-transform can be used to transform text into uppercase or lowercase

If an HTML element needs to styled uniquely no matter what class is applied to it 
We use id for declaring it
        <h1 id="" class="bold"> </h1>
For manipulating it, we use # in CSS

<h1 id="article-title" class="title uppercase">

In this example, we are uniquely styling via id and adding the CSS elements attributed to title and uppercase
While classes are meant to be used many times, an ID is meant to style only one element.

classes can be .bold 
classes can be .uppercase
classes can be .blue

With an html we can use <h1 class="bold blue uppercase> </h1>


Specificity:
This is a way in CSS to holder precedence over other element attributes
        ID's are most Specific
        Classes come next
        Followed last by tags
<h1 id="green" class="red"></h1>

the css :
    #green {
        color: green
    }
    .red {
        color: red
    }
    h1{
        color:blue
    }
In this case, the H1 will be green since its most Specific

When writing CSS rules, itâ€™s possible to require an HTML element to have two 
or more CSS selectors at the same time.

    This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. 
    For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:

h1.special {

}
